An app that allows (and teaches! - stretch goal) users to build a hearthstone deck

Pseudocode:

- Make a call to HearthstoneAPI and retreive a list of cards (limit to STANDARD for now)
- Sort cards into categories by class
- Display cards
    - Paged (Scroll?)
- Allow users to build a deck
    - choose class
    - choose 30
        - limit to 2 copies of each card

Mini Stretch: 
- Give 'hint' cards
    - cards that go well together - hunt for keywords like 'divine shield' or 'beast'
- Allow filtering of cards
    - Search
    - Cost
    - Expansion
- Display cost curve of deck
- Explain what each thing means

Real Stretch:
- Cool Aesthetics
    - That magic scroll thing from gilbert
- Allow saving & retrieval of decks/partial decks
- Import WILD cards too
- Build out logic for card interactions
- Teach the user how to build a deck!
- Import (maybe just hard code) interesting deck templates & good decks

- Export your deck
- Import your collection (Blizzard API - OAuth!)
